Difference btween yarn and npm ?
------------------------------
npm: It is a package manager for the JavaScript programming language. 
It is the default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js.
It consists of a command-line client, also called npm, and an online database of 
public and paid-for private packages called the npm registry.

yarn: It stands for Yet Another Resource Negotiator and it is a package manager 
just like npm. It was developed by Facebook and is now open-source. 
The intention behind developing yarn(at that time) was to fix performance and security 
concerns with npm.

npm: npm is installed with Node automatically.
yarn: To install yarn npm have to be installed.
npm install yarn --global
